Description:

In this folder, the results of our projects are mentioned, in which there are multiple graphs to undertand thr RMSE and MAE of an actual and pridected value of a ratings.

In this project, We have developed a movie recommendation system using a collaborative filtering technique. The plan recommends movies to the user based on the ratings given by other similar users. We have used the Pearson correlation and cosine similarity to calculate user similarity. We have also filtered the movies based on the number of ratings they received and kept the movies with over 100 ratings. Finally, we have used the item scores to recommend top movies to the user. So, we analyzed the model using RMSE, MAE, and precision and recall; we got an average of the model is 80%.
