Description:

In this folder, the colob code is attached here, the code describes how to train a model and test the model and then finding the similer user using pearson and cosine similerity of for an given user.

In this project, We have developed a movie recommendation system using a collaborative filtering technique. The plan recommends movies to the user based on the ratings given by other similar users. We have used the Pearson correlation and cosine similarity to calculate user similarity. We have also filtered the movies based on the number of ratings they received and kept the movies with over 100 ratings. Finally, we have used the item scores to recommend top movies to the user. So, we analyzed the model using RMSE, MAE, and precision and recall; we got an average of the model is 80%.
